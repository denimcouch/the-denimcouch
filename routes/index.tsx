                I am a full stack developer located in Houston, TX. I enjoy
                making things that are pretty and accessible to as many folks as
                possible! I specialize in frontend technologies, but am always
                comfortable finding the right solution for any given problem.

                But enough stuffy professional jobspeak, Let's talk about fun
                stuff!

                I am a daydreamer who gets lost envisioning a better world. I am
                driven by curiousity and kindness. If I had nothing else to do,
                I would spend my day walking through the streets of Houston,
                bathed in heat and smiling as I get a taste of every yummy
                morsel of food I find.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love people. I love food. I love games found on the tabletop
                and on the screen.
              </p>

                In another life I was a coffee roaster, and by other life I mean
                I used to be a coffee roaster and it was so much fun. I also
                love coffee. Chances are if I'm not at home, I'm at a coffee
                shop. Chat with me about coffee anytime honestly.
