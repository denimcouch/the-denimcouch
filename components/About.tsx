            I am a full stack developer located in Houston, TX. I enjoy making
            things that are pretty and accessible to as many folks as possible!
            I specialize in frontend technologies, but am always comfortable
            finding the right solution for any given problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            But enough stuffy professional jobspeak, Let's talk about fun stuff!

            I am a daydreamer who gets lost envisioning a better world. I am
            driven by curiousity and kindness. If I had nothing else to do, I
            would spend my day walking through the streets of Houston, bathed in
            heat and smiling as I get a taste of every yummy morsel of food I
            find.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love people. I love food. I love games found on the tabletop and
            on the screen.
          </p>

            In another life I was a coffee roaster, and by other life I mean I
            used to be a coffee roaster and it was so much fun. I also love
            coffee. Chances are if I'm not at home, I'm at a coffee shop. Chat
            with me about coffee anytime honestly.

            taking some time outta your day to read these words ‚ú®
